# AlShifa Hospital Comprehensive Network Infrastructure

**Designed and Configured by:**  
**Sherif Thabit Ahmed Jacoub** (Team Leader & Troubleshooting)  
**Help Desk Support:**  
**Mahmoud Al Sayed Shreef**

## Overview
This repository outlines the comprehensive network infrastructure design and implementation for **AlShifa Hospital**. The network infrastructure was carefully designed to ensure high availability, redundancy, security, and efficiency across all devices and departments within the hospital.

## Key Highlights:
- **Redundancy and High Availability:** The network uses HSRP and EtherChannel to ensure continuous service and minimize downtime.
- **Layer 2 Configuration:** VLANs are set up to segment traffic effectively, preventing loops with STP (Spanning Tree Protocol).
- **Layer 3 Configuration:** OSPF is implemented for dynamic routing between different subnets in the hospital network.
- **Device Security:** Strong password protection, SSH access, port security, and role-based access control (RBAC) are implemented to restrict unauthorized access.

## Project Members:
- **Sherif Thabit Ahmed Jacoub:** Lead designer, configuration, and troubleshooting.
- **Mahmoud Al Sayed Shreef:** Help Desk Support and general assistance.

## Technologies Used:
- HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
- EtherChannel
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- SSH
- VLANs
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
  
## Project Objectives:
- Provide a reliable and redundant network for AlShifa Hospital.
- Ensure that the hospital's network can handle the demands of multiple devices, services, and critical applications.
- Implement secure access and traffic segmentation to protect sensitive hospital data.
